what is ai?
-> Human intelligence, exhibited by machines

- In industry, we have something called narrow ai. means, machine can be as good as or even better than humans.
- But, narrow ai can be better only at any one of the fields, like playing chess, or predicting heart disease by looking at the images.
- Machines better at everything, is called general ai. Which is not possible as of now.

Machine learning 

- machine learning is an approach to achieve successfull ai.
- According to standford, machine learning is the science of getting computers to act (solve a problem) without being explictly programmed 

Deep learning --- deep learning is a kind of algorithm to implement machine learning

Data science --- Analysing data, and then doing something with it.

Teachable machine --- a web application developed by google, demonstrating machine learning


Big Data --- After relational databases, a lot of information were being accumulated by companies like google, facebook etc etc. It became really 
			 messy to store data in a relational databases. This is what is big data. Big data, brings noSql into picture, like mongodb. 
			 Eventually, the data grew so much, that it became impossible for a human being to look and make pridictions with it.
			 This marked the beginning of machine learning

Types of machine learning ---


1. Supervised learning --- here, we have labelled csv kind of, data and labelled input test case, to generate output.
2. Unsupervised learning --- here, we have unlabelled cse kind of data, and here clustering is done by machines. here,
							 machines make groups itself.
3. Reinforcement learning --- here, machines learn itself, by millions of trial and error, rewards and punishments.

===============================Difference between normal computer algorithms and machine learning algorithms====================================

normal algorithms start with set of inputs, and set of instructions to be performed on the inputs to get an output
	eg:- To make tea, normal algorithm contains--- inputs like milk, sugar, tea leaves etc etc, and the set of instructions like boil the milk, 
		 add sugar and tea leaves etc etc. Eventually the output is tea.

machine learning algorithms start with set of inputs and an ideal output. And then machine learning algorithms tries to predict the instructions 
to generate the output.

	eg:- To make tea, ml algorithm contains --- inputs like milk, sugar, tea leaves etc etc, and an ideal tea. 
		 The objective of ml algorithm or model is to predict the steps to make tea, after 100s of trials. This is reinforcement learning

Data analysis --- Looking at the set of data, and gaining some informations based upon the available data.
Data science --- Experimenting on the set of data, and using it for good. Like Experimenting on the input for making a tea, and trying to 
				 predict the steps to make one.

Data analysis and machine learning is a part of Data science
