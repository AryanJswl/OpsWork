- Devops is basically automation of SDLC.
- It resolves the chaos developed due to dev and ops team.

- Jenkins is an automation tool used to fetch the code by dev team from the code repo to the build server,
  builds the code and in case of any error send a ping to the dev team about the same,
  dev team fixes the issue and pushes the code to the code repo and the cycle repeats.
