- Devops is basically automation of SDLC.
- It resolves the chaos developed due to dev and ops team.

- Jenkins is an automation tool used to fetch the code by dev team from the code repo to the build server,
  builds the code and in case of any error send a ping to the dev team about the same,
  dev team fixes the issue and pushes the code to the code repo and the cycle repeats.

  In devops we use:

  1. build automation tools
  2. automation testing tools
  3. Configuration management tools
  4. Infrastructure deployment tools
  5. Infrastructure management tools
  6. monitoring (application program monitoring, server monitoring, infra monitoring)

  - Roles:
  1. cicd pipelines development and management
  2. application monitoring 


  Output of the build is called artifact.
