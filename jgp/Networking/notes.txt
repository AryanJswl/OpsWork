- 2 or more than 2 computers connected with each other by some means, in a way where they can share informations, is networking
- All the internet enabled devices are connected to each other via --- isp --- submarine cable --- isp 
- host --- any device which gets an ip address in a network.
- Types of network  
    1. LAN
    2. WAN
    
- WAN is again of 2 types ---
    1. private WAN --- when there is a dedicated line connection (leased lines) between different LANs spread across different geo zones.
    2. public WAN --- when different LANs spread across different geo zones are connected via internet. 

- switches --- helps connecting differnet computers togather, and establish LAN connection.
- routers --- helps connecting different networks togather.

- Devices in a network have NIC (network interface cards) installed it due to which they can connet to the network.
  and it is the NIC which has the MAC address. 

- ip addresses ---

    ip addresses have 2 parts 
    1. network part (N)
    2. host part (H)

    for the systems to communicate, the network portion of their ip addresses should match, 

- ipv4 address classes ---
    1. class a
    2. class b
    3. class c

- class a --- when first octate is between 1 and 126
- class b --- when first octate is between 128 - 191
- class c --- when first octate is between 192 - 223

- class d and class e are not used by computers


subnet mask (represents network bits) --- used to determine weather the systems in network having their ip addresses will communicate
                same as CIDR.

                                                           ip address         subnet mask 

--- then first octate needs to be equal to communicate.    N.H.H.H            255.0.0.0
--- first 2 octates needs to be equal to communicate.      N.N.H.H            255.255.0.0
--- first 3 octates needs to be equal to communicate.      N.N.N.H            255.255.255.0



127 --- loopback ips, ie self own ip or localhost.
0 --- is also reserved.
- windows firewall is a fucker, it can blow your mind by not allowing to access shared folders and files

- types of ip addresses:
1. ipv4 --- 32 bits, have 4 groups, each of 8 bits
2. ipv6 --- 128 bits, have 8 groups, each of 16 bits

we use ipv6 because we have shortage of ipv4

IANA --- internet assigned number authority is a org. who oversees the ip addresses, domain names and protocol assignments and 
         their port number.

        when we need to buy 4 5 ips then we don't need to go to apnic, if too many ips to be bought, then sure apnic is the way.

        after we buy our own ip, we need to announce it to global routing table

IANA has formed regional internet registries (rir). We go to rir to buy ip addresses.
for asia it is --- apnic.




isp hirarchy ---
1. tire 1 
2. tire 2
3. tire 3

hub works on signals and is a layer 1 device --- so it always broadcast the messages, switches don't 
switches store the mac address of the device connected, hence is better.

Routers used by ISPs:
1. ISR (Integrated service routers)
2. ASR (Aggrated service routers)
3. CSR ()


OSI model:

1. Application layer - softwares which interacts one human to another. Concerned with the transfer of the raw data, like transfer of 
    music files, videos, messages, emails, text messages etc.
    protocols: HTTP, HTTPS - used by www, so that we can access the web sites.
               SMTP --- send email 
               POP (post office protocol), IMAP (internet message access protocol) --- recieve email
               SSH or telnet --- remotely access the devices.

2. Presentation layer - Responsibe for representation of data in correct format, like videos in mp4, images in mp3 etc.
                for encryption and decryption or compression and decompression.

3. session layer - responsible for creating and maintaining the session (timeframes) withing the site.

4. Transport layer - changes the data into multiple segments and sequencing occures. Retransmission also occurs here.
                     responsible for end to end delivery (transmission of data from source to destination)
            TCP                                         |                       UDP
        ------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------
        transmission is followed by acknowledgement          transmission is not followed by acknowledgement 
        of the same.                                         of the same.

        Retransmission occures in case of segment lost.       No Retransmission.

        it takes 20 bytes segments                            it takes 8 bytes.

        ip number is 6                                        ip number is 17 


Both of them add port numbers in the 20 or 8 bytes.

5. Network layer - segments are converted into packets by appending the ip address of the source and destination addresses.
                   routers work here.

6. Datalink layer - packets are converted into frames by this layer by appending the mac address of the source and destination 
                    addresses. switches work here. 

7. Physical layer - packets are encoded to be transferred, by wires to signals or by wireless mediums to waves.
                                                     
no encapsulation occures in physical layer.

- router is responsible to choose the best path for data transfer.

ietf -> iana -> rir -> isp -> end users
