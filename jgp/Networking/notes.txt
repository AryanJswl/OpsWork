- 2 or more than 2 computers connected with each other by some means, in a way where they can share informations, is networking
- All the internet enabled devices are connected to each other via --- isp --- submarine cable --- isp 
- host --- any device which gets an ip address in a network.
- Types of network  
    1. LAN
    2. WAN
    
- WAN is again of 2 types ---
    1. private WAN --- when there is a dedicated line connection (leased lines) between different LANs spread across different geo zones.
    2. public WAN --- when different LANs spread across different geo zones are connected via internet. 

- switches --- helps connecting differnet computers togather, and establish LAN connection.
- routers --- helps connecting different networks togather.

- Devices in a network have NIC (network interface cards) installed it due to which they can connet to the network.
  and it is the NIC which has the MAC address. 


- ip address classes ---
    1. class 
    2. class b
    3. class c

- class a --- when first octate is between 1 and 126 --- then first octate needs to be equal to communicate.
- class b --- when first octate is between 128 - 191 --- first 2 octates needs to be equal to communicate. 
- class c --- when first octate is between 192 - 223 --- first 3 octates needs to be equal to communicate.

127 --- loopback ips, ie self own ip or localhost.
0 --- is also reserved.
- windows firewall is a fucker, it can blow your mind by not allowing to access shared folders and files

- types of ip addresses:
1. ipv4 --- 32 bits, have 4 groups, each of 8 bits
2. ipv6 --- 128 bits, have 8 groups, each of 16 bits

we use ipv6 because we have shortage of ipv4

IANA --- internet assigned number authority is a org. who oversees the ip addresses, domain names, weather they are 
    according to internet standards.

IANA has formed regional internet registris (rir). We go to rir to buy ip addresses.
for asia it is --- apnic.


isp hirarchy ---
1. tire 1 
2. tire 2
3. tire 3

hub works on signals and is a layer 1 device --- so it always broadcast the messages, switches don't 
switches store the mac address of the device connected, hence is better.

Routers used by ISPs:
1. ISR (Integrated service routers)
2. ASR (Aggrated service routers)
3. CSR ()


OSI model:

1. Application layer - softwares which interacts one human to another. 
    protocols: HTTP, HTTPS - used in web browsers
               SMTP --- send email 
               POP (post office protocol), IMAP (internet message access protocol) --- recieve email
