- 2 or more than 2 computers connected with each other by some means, in a way where they can share informations, is networking
- All the internet enabled devices are connected to each other via --- isp --- submarine cable --- isp 
- host --- any device which gets an ip address in a network.
- Types of network  
    1. LAN
    2. WAN
    
- WAN is again of 2 types ---
    1. private WAN --- when there is a dedicated line connection (leased lines) between different LANs spread across different geo zones.
    2. public WAN --- when different LANs spread across different geo zones are connected via internet. 

- switches --- helps connecting differnet computers togather, and establish LAN connection.
- routers --- helps connecting different networks togather.

- Devices in a network have NIC (network interface cards) installed it due to which they can connet to the network.
  and it is the NIC which has the MAC address. 


- ip address classes ---
    1. class 
    2. class b
    3. class c

- class a --- when first octate is between 1 and 126 --- then first octate needs to be equal to communicate.
- class b --- when first octate is between 128 - 191 --- first 2 octates needs to be equal to communicate. 
- class c --- when first octate is between 192 - 223 --- first 3 octates needs to be equal to communicate.

127 --- loopback ips, ie self own ip or localhost.
0 --- is also reserved.
- windows firewall is a fucker, it can blow your mind by not allowing to access shared folders and files

- types of ip addresses:
1. ipv4 --- 32 bits, have 4 groups, each of 8 bits
2. ipv6 --- 128 bits, have 8 groups, each of 16 bits

we use ipv6 because we have shortage of ipv4
