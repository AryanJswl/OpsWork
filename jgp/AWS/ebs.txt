EBS is a block storage
ephemeral storage in an ec2 --- ram 

throughput --- measure of unit of data transferred per second
iops --- measure of no of i/o operations per second
With 3000 IOPS/Gib you have 3000 operations of input/output per second, with the capacity to transfer 1Gib.

burst performance --- sudden surge beyond max performance. It's available for a little time. if need more time then pay
    eg: burst performance of 3000 iops --- sudden surge in iops could be upto 3000

EBS types ---
    1. general purpose ssd 
    2. provisioned ssd
    3. throughput optimized hdd
    4. cold storage hdd

- With provisioned iops ssd, we have a feature of multi attach --- attach multiple (upto 16) ec2 instances with the same EBS
- But, ec2 instances should be nitro based
