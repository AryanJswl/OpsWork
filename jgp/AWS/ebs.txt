EBS is a block storage
ephemeral storage in an ec2 --- ram 

throughput --- measure of unit of data transferred per second
iops --- measure of no of i/o operations per second
With 3000 IOPS/Gib you have 3000 operations of input/output per second, with the capacity to transfer 1Gib.

burst performance --- sudden surge beyond max performance. It's available for a little time. if need more time then pay
    eg: burst performance of 3000 iops --- sudden surge in iops could be upto 3000

EBS types ---
    1. general purpose ssd 
    2. provisioned ssd
    3. throughput optimized hdd
    4. cold storage hdd

- With provisioned iops ssd, we have a feature of multi attach --- attach multiple (upto 16) ec2 instances with the same EBS
- But, ec2 instances should be nitro based

- Backing up data in ebs --- snapshot
- snapshots are stored in s3
- first snapshot creates backup of all the files but eventually, next snapshots just creates the new files added, not the old ones.

- we can copy snapshots from one region to another
- During copying we can also encrypt data.

DLM --- Data Lifecycle Manager
    We can automate backup and restore works for ebs, in fixed time intervals
    We can provide lifecycle policies for an ebs snapshot based on tags.
    eg:- We want to create the backup only for 30 days. 
         After 30 days the backup will be deleted
    This is free to use. 

EBS created will be available to the instances in the same availability zones.
- for encryption, check encrypt and select master key ---- will be encrypted.
- n no of ebs volumes can be attached to an instance

lsblk --- lists all the blocks attached to the instance
