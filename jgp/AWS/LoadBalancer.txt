- Load balancer is a service that uniformly distributes traffic to different servers.
- It increases the availability and fault tolerance of the application.
- ELB is a load balancing service for AWS deployments.
- Any request coming in will have to go through the load balancer. 


Types of elastic loadbalancer:

Classical loadbalancer --- traditional loadbalancer, randomly sends clients request to different servers.
    internet loadbalancer --- public servers
    internal facing loadbalancer --- private server (VPC)

Network loadbalancer --- Good for handling suddent and violent traffic surge.
    Can handle millions of requests per second.

Application loadbalancer --- identifies the incoming request and directs it to appropriate server from the different servers present
    - cross zone load balancing --- here, the load balancer directs the incoming request to private subnets of different zones too.
    - weighted routing system --- have two different versions of the application in different zones with weights 8 and 2 say 
        - would direct 80% requests to 8 weighted route and 20% to 2 weighted route.
        - this is also called blue/green deployment.
