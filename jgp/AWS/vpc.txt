- vpc --- virtual private cloud
- vpc is a logically isolated sections in aws
- SOD --- segegration of duties.
- isolation is required as, say a developer should not interfare with the database stuffs, and so required vpc.
- vpc acts as a boundary, like college boundary, which ensures that no non-college guys roam inside the campus unnecessarily.
- vpc is regional service.
- there is a default vpc in every region.
- a single vpc can not span across mulitple region.
- within a vpc, also we need isolation in the resource level, 
    eg:- an instance which can overrite in a database when the customer uses the instance.
    we can't provide direct access to the database.
- This isolation within the resource level is provided by subnet.
- subnet isolates public resources from private resources
- Hence, there is a public subnet and a private subnet.
- in a region there is a vpc, in vpc there can be availability zones, in az there can be subnets.
