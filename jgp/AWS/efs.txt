EFS is a cloud based file-storage service.
Its based on NFS --- Network File System.
Here, we can attach multiple ec2 instances except windows to a single EFS identifier.
For windows it's FSX, to do the same.

It's basically distributed file system, where files are accessed from a remote device and seem to be present in the local computer.

*** Install nfs-common (nfs client) in the instance before mounting EFS storage --- uses nfs protocol

EFS storage service can scale automatically.
