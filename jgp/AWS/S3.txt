- Simple Storage Service.
- S3 can be accessed via APIs, over the internet.
- S3 can be integrated with other aws services.
- Data can be uploaded via, management console, aws-cli or via amazon APIs
    These amazon APIs can be used in some programs developed by you to upload data directly to s3.
- name --- globally unique
- regional service but s3 buckets can be accessed globally


Consistency model

- replication of data in different data centers within same region to avoid accidental data deletion.
- Read after write Consistency
***Making folder --- There is no actual folder in bucket, folder just creates another path within the repo/bucket
- Data are stored in form of objects, and metadata associated with those objects.
- can store unstructured data
- unlimited amount of data can be stored
- Size limit of individual object --- 5tb
- by default public access is blocked
- To make it public -:
    Bucket policy --- resource based policy --- applied at service level, applied at s3.bucket
    Bucket policy --- used to generate any type of policy to be used for the bucket.
    Policy generator --- used to create policy.
    *** arn --- unique name of everything inside aws services ***
    File structure --- flat structure, as no concept of actual folders. They are all virtual.
    *** prefix and suffix concept ***
        img/ -> image.jpg
        here, img is prefix and jpg is suffix.

Versioning

- Keeping records of previous edits in the file.
- Policy action: Get object version to get the different versions of the file.


**********************************
Policy generator

Effect: allow/deny --- allows or denys the action
principal: tell to whom, the action is allowed or denyed (in terms of service name)
    service: about service
action: operation to be allowed or denyed
Resource: arn name who is allowed to perform.

S3 use case:

- static website hosting
- event notification --- feature in s3, notifies the selected destinations about any event when it occurs in s3
    SNS (Simple Notification Service) --- Generates notifications (A destination)
        access policy --- defines, who can access sns.
        By default, only owner can publish or subscribe to sns.
        Subscription filter policy --- customizes the message to be recieved 

Storage class:

    To keep files for different durations
    Minimun storage duration --- It simply means that, even if you delete your objects before that minimum duration, 
                                 they will assume that you have stored for minimum duration and charge your for that time.

    Also referred as - lifecycle rule 


Access Control List --- Another way to control access to bucket and object, other than bucket policy.
    - Bucket policy is applied at bucket level./ ie, on bucket's permissions. Whereas, acl applies at bucket level
      and at object level too.

But, bucket policy is preferred over ACLs.

- URL to access objects --- https://{bucket-name}.s3.{region-name}.amazonaws.com/{object-name}


CORS --- Cross origin resource sharing (found under permissions section)

- Needs to be enabled, when there is a content sharing between two differnt buckets
  Enabled in the source bucket.


- lifecycle application on objects --- transition from one storage class to another or Expiration
