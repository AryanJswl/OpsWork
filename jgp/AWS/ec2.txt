Remotely accessing a service over the internet or intranet is called CLOUD COMPUTING.
Staiistically, 33% of websites in the internet uses aws 

==========================REGIONS OF AWS================================

26 regions	

collection of servers ---- data center  
collection of data center ---- availability zone
collection of az --- region

1 digit milli second latency between two az

300+ services in total, aws provides for ml, devops, data science

economy of scales ---- 10kg - 20 rs but if 100kg - 4rs

========================================================================

Types of cloud computing service models ---

IAAS --- cloud will provide networking features, storage space etc. Hardware and os will be managed by you.
PAAS --- iaas + os + ide + sdk, just need to put in the code.
SAAS --- means just subscribe or login and enjoy.

Read difference --- https://qr.ae/pvZjky

To get a print out of your some college doc, say result card.

iaas --- you go to shop, choose a printer with desired configuration, buy it and perform the printing operation
paas --- you go to cyber cafe, give the soft copy of the doc. to cafe owner. And take the printout
saas --- you get the print out from the college itself.


Types of cloud deployment models ---
1. Public eg:- gcp, ibm bluemix, rackspace
2. Private - cloud infra dedicated to a company only, ie only the company can provision vms on the cloud.  
3. Hybrid

========================================================================

Q1.How to select a region?
-> 1. Customer proxmity
   2. Service availability
   3. Cost
   4. governance and compliance

=========================================================================

Virtualisation - one machine, logically segregated into multiple machines

making virtual servers (laptops kind of) using hypervisor.
And all the resources of the physical server is divided into different virtual servers

=========================================================================

AWS uses type 1 hyperviser named xen hyperviser

AWS SERVICE domains

	1. COMPUTE -- SERVERS TO RUN OUR APPLICATION 
	2. STORAGE -- MEMORY TO STORE DATA
	3. NETWORKING -- COMMUNICATION 
	4. DATABASE -- TRANSACTIONS LIKE CRUD OPERATIONS
	5. ...

IAM --- IDENTITY AND ACCESS MANAGEMENT under Management and governance

	Authentication --- validation of credentials 
	Authorisation --- permissions grant

IAM manages things like who has access to what
Here IDENTITY means user
IAM is a global service

Elements of iam
1. users -- Authentication
2. roles -- Authentication
3. groups -- best practice
4. policies -- Authorization

Groups are a collection of users and a user can be a part of multiple groups

Ways to interact with aws services

	There are 3 ways

	1. Management console, ie gui or web based interface
	2. Command line interface --- programmatic access 
	3. Software development kit, ie we can build software on our own to interact with the services --- programmatic access

	Access key and secret key --- needed when interacting through local machine
	aws login credentials --- needed when interacting through management console


******All the services are shared accorss different iam users and root user within an account.******


================================CONFIGURE AWS IN CLI IN LOCAL MACHINE=========================================

> aws configure --- configures aws in local machine. need to give access key and secret key
		> aws s3 ls --- lists the buckets in s3
		>> syntax of aws commands --- aws {service name} {operation name} 



*** segregation of duties --- dividing the duties to different users

Profiling --- used to configure multiple users in same machine, distinguishing them by profile name like developer,
ml engineer etc.

> aws configure --profile {profile name} --- configures according to profile name
	eg:- aws configure --profile developer 

> aws {service name} {operation name} --profile {profile name} --- does the operation of the user in a profile
	eg:- aws s3 ls --profile developer


aws policy simulator --- checks if an operation is allowed for a user or not

IAM policies --- set of instructions which defines the permissions a user or group or role can have. It is a json based text

Types of iam policies ---
1. Inline --- can only be assigned to the user, in which it is created
2. Managed --- generic policies, ie, they can be granted to any user also many at a time
	a. aws managed
	b. customer managed

	In policy creation, resource means the service running, like one of the instances 

	In policies, a deny has higher precedence over allow

=========================IAM ROLE=================================

- credentials --- access key and secret key
- iam role is a secure way to access management console as, 
  credentials associated with iam role is temporary or dynamically generated unlike iam user.
- Here, credentials are not managed by us, it is managed by aws. So, less chance that credentials are compromised.
- With iam role session duration is attached like 1 hr. --- new credentials are generated after every 1 hr.
- session duration can be set by us. by default, it is 1hr  
- aws provide, iam roles programmatic access, ie via cli or sdk

- there is a service named security token service (sts), it has an api called assume role api, resposible for credential generation
- credential is gerenrated in background


*** aws quota is a thing to check the limit --- in aws docs ***
*** cloud migration means migrating to cloud from on premise server ***

*** federation or IDENTITY PROVIDER --- establishing trust between two entities, like quora server and google server *** 

##### HOW TO CREATE ROLES######
docs ---- aws federation	

============================================================================================================================

========================================================EC2=================================================================

It is a regional service.
Provide computing services.

types of ec2 --- it is based on the specification

1. general purpose --- overall great
2. memory optimized --- ram is more
3. storage optimized --- high storage
4. Acclerated computing --- balance between ram and virtual cpu, can handle sudden traffic hikes
5. Compute optimized --- virtual cpu is more, it is not good for sudden traffic hikes, good for ml


different ways to launch ec2 instances:

1. on demand --- whenever needed, launch the instance, and terminate when done.
2. reserved instances --- reserve an instance for a couple of time like 3 yrs.

difference between on demand and reserved instances is, we get a decent amount of discount if we plan to go with 
reserved instance.

3. dedicated host --- kinda private jet. The whole server is allocated along with the hypervisor. (due to HIPAA compliance)
	Licensing softwares, needs the access to physical core and mac address. In those cases, whole bare metal needs to be taken.
4. spot instances --- basically biding for a not so stable instance at a very cheaper rate, kinda.


Hyper-threading is a process by which a CPU divides up its physical cores into virtual cores that are 
treated as if they are actually physical cores by the operating system.

hyper threading --- https://qr.ae/pvZjq4
	virtual cores are just 2 desks for the physical core (human) to work.
	It reduces the switching time between two threads.
	It allows multiple threads to run in the core of cpu.

Virtual cpu (vCPU) --- Each vcpu is a hyper-thread of an Intel xeon core. 

Key pair--- private key is with you, public key in the instance. public key is decyfered using the private key and instance is launched
	Once created it can't be accessed again, so keep the key pair safe 

AMI is basically backup of all the system files and other files in the instance, hardware configurations can change.

Security groups allow different ip addresses to access the instances

Key pairs are region specific, one key pair in one region can't be used in another region

We can change the ec2 instance type anytime, hence it's elastic

=============================================================================================================================

ssh protocol --- used to connect to linux machines remotely
firewall --- security system of a machine. decides, what type of traffic is allowed and what are blocked
		security group is a virtual firewall, ie firewall for virtual machines.

inbound --- traffic comming to our server
outbound --- traffic going out of server

*** Read aws output format *** 

> AMI

Creating ami of our own --- creating snapshots
We can also copy ami from one region to another.
AMI are stored in s3 buckets.


elastic ip --- when allocated, doesn't change after instance restarts.
when unallocated, it gets billed.

0.0.0.0/0 --- means all the networks 

public key pair is present in the key pair section on ec2.
private key is generated only at the generation of the key pair.
public key and private key is nothing but a lock and key 
	public key is lock and private key is key to open the lock.

copy fileName from system to instance --- scp -i "Key name" fileName instancePublicDNS: --- will be available on home dir.

ngnix --- used to build web servers and host multiple websites.

when restarted, ec2 instances change physical hardware, within same data center.

Service Legal Agreement (sla) --- 99.99% uptime
	means in 100 unit of time, instance will be up for at least 99.99 units

This sla can be for any aws service.
