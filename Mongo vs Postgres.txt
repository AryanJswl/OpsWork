Mongo vs Postgres:

When PostgreSQL says that something has been saved, it really has landed on hard drive. 
Mongo instead queues it up to be "saved eventually" meaning that you can expect that 
while 99.9% of the data will go through fine, that remaining 0.1% might be gone (lack 
of hard drive space, some kind of OS bug, power shutdown). Not important if you are 
making a comment system on Reddit, will destroy your business if you try to store 
financial records in it.

No real support for foreign keys for Mongo, at least not on a database layer. Example - you 
might decide that it should be impossible to delete a customer if there are orders still 
belonging to them. On Postgres it's a child's play but on Mongo you need to implement it 
inside your application stack (which is waaaay more error prone as this check is bypassed 
if you work with database directly).

PostgreSQL is (assuming a single database server) generally faster if you need to find a 
dataset that requires using several different tables. As an example - "find Orders made 
between 11.2010 - 11.2014 by Customers that have used reddit registration PromoCode and 
their Shipping was done by USPS". 4 different tables (customers, promo_codes, shippings, orders).

On the other hand MongoDB has better support for multi-server infrastructure, at least when 
it comes to simultaneous writes and sharding (splitting your database in such a way that for 
instance customers with names from A to M are on one server and from N to Z on another).
