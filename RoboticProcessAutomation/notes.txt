RPA solutions allow organisations to do more with less effort.
a not so sneaky fact, robots operates 3 times faster than humans. 
RPA tools are used to build bots which mimic human jobs in a more efficient ways

Automation anywhere a2019 automation tool is one of the RPA tools
It is based on AI and ML technologies. It is a cloud native rpa tool.
cloud native tools - these are highly scalable applications which are deployed in public, private or hybrid cloud.

Architecture of Automation anywhere

There are 3 parts in the Architecture -
1. control room - core of the software, by which the bots are controlled, monitored and managed.
2. bots creator - used to create the bots.
3. bots runner - runtime client, used to run bots the device.

RPA lifecycle ---

1. discovery phase --- processes to be automated are identified.
2. solution design phase --- rpa solution is designedl.
3. development phase --- bots are created for the process.
4. testing phase --- bots are tested for the functionality.
5. deployment phase --- bots are deployed on the production machines.
6. suport and mentainance phase --- bots are monitored and maintained for their work.

limiations as of now ---

1. process should be rule based.
2. data involved in the process should be in digital format like pdfs, images, excel docs etc.
